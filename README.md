-Behaviour trees based on: http://magicscrollsofcode.blogspot.com.au/2010/12/behavior-trees-by-example-ai-in-android.html


Currently an isometric low fantasy-crime rpg-strategy. Low fantasy, goblins, dwarves, humans, rodent people, with a Unique twist. None of the standard elves vs dwarves, good vs evil tropes. Start as a poor beggar and build relationships, make deals, take over turf and eliminate your competitors, working your way up to a crime lord, nobility and/or a trade empire spanning common goods, drugs, weapons and/or slaves
