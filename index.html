        <p>Hi, I am Ado and I have been working on Project Trader for just over 2 years. It started out as a learning project after I made my first <em>Pong</em> clone with Java2d. <br>
           It was originally going to be a 2d birds-eye view, action game similar to GTA 1 and 2 but I quickly got tired of the perspective and changed the game to an isometric view. The theme of the game changed <br>
            to a poltergiest-possession based game which was shelved after I got the AI and animations up and running.
